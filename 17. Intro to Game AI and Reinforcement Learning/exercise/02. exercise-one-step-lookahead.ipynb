You will define these values in the code cell below.\n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FBoWr2f.png\" width=80%><br/>\n</center>\n    \n\nTo check your answer, we use your values to create a heuristic function as follows:\n\n```python\ndef get_heuristic_q1(grid, col, mark, config):\n    num_twos = count_windows(grid, 2, mark, config)\n    num_threes = count_windows(grid, 3, mark, config)\n    num_fours = count_windows(grid, 4, mark, config)\n    num_twos_opp = count_windows(grid, 2, mark%2+1, config)\n    num_threes_opp = count_windows(grid, 3, mark%2+1, config)\n    score = A*num_fours + B*num_threes + C*num_twos + D*num_twos_opp + E*num_threes_opp\n    return score\n```\n\nThis heuristic is then used to create an agent, that competes against the agent from the tutorial in 50 different game rounds.  In order to be marked correct, \n- your agent must win at least half of the games, and\n- `C` and `D` must both be nonzero.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# TODO: Assign your values here\nA = 1e10\nB = 1e4\nC = 1e2\nD = -1\nE = -1e6\n\n# Check your answer (this will take a few seconds to run!)\nq_1.check()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-29T16:48:36.810126Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-29T16:48:36.810521Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-29T16:48:56.411169Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-29T16:48:36.810489Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-29T16:48:56.409861Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lines below will give you a hint or solution code\n#q_1.hint()\n#q_1.solution()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-29T16:49:11.151174Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-29T16:49:11.151573Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-29T16:49:11.156463Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-29T16:49:11.151540Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-29T16:49:11.155530Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2) Does the agent win?\n\nConsider the game board below.  \n\n<center>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AlnaQ3J.png\" width=30%><br/>\n</center>\n\nSay the agent uses red discs, and it's the agent's turn.  \n- If the agent uses the heuristic **_from the tutorial_**, does it win or lose the game?\n- If the agent uses the heuristic **_that you just implemented_**, does it win or lose the game?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#q_2.hint()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check your answer (Run this code cell to receive credit!)\nq_2.solution()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-29T16:49:23.683315Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-29T16:49:23.683905Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-29T16:49:23.695900Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-29T16:49:23.683841Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-29T16:49:23.694632Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3) Submit to the competition\n\nNow, it's time to submit an agent to the competition!
