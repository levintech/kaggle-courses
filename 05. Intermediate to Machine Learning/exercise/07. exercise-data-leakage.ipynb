Your first assignment is to review a model one of their employees built to predict how many shoelaces they'll need each month. The features going into the machine learning model include:\n- The current month (January, February, etc)\n- Advertising expenditures in the previous month\n- Various macroeconomic features (like the unemployment rate) as of the beginning of the current month\n- The amount of leather they ended up using in the current month\n\nThe results show the model is almost perfectly accurate if you include the feature about how much leather they used. But it is only moderately accurate if you leave that feature out. You realize this is because the amount of leather they use is a perfect indicator of how many shoes they produce, which in turn tells you how many shoelaces they need.\n\nDo you think the _leather used_ feature constitutes a source of data leakage?

His plan is to purchase the cryptocurrency whenever the model says the price of the currency (in dollars) is about to go up.\n\nThe most important features in his model are:\n- Current price of the currency\n- Amount of the currency sold in the last 24 hours\n- Change in the currency price in the last 24 hours\n- Change in the currency price in the last 1 hour\n- Number of new tweets in the last 24 hours that mention the currency\n\nThe value of the cryptocurrency in dollars has fluctuated up and down by over $\\$$100 in the last year, and yet his model's average error is less than $\\$$1.
