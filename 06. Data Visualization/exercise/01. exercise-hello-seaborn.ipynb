Along the way, you'll receive feedback on your work.  You'll see if your answer is right, get customized hints, and see the official solution (_if you'd like to take a look!_).\n\nTo explore the feedback system, we'll start with a simple example of a coding problem.  Follow the following steps in order:\n1. Run the code cell below without making any edits.  It will show the following output: \n> <font color='#ccaa33'>Check:</font> When you've updated the starter code, `check()` will tell you whether your code is correct. You need to update the code that creates variable `one`\n\n    This means you need to change the code to set the variable `one` to something other than the blank provided below (`____`).\n\n\n2. Replace the underline with a `2`, so that the line of code appears as `one = 2`.  Then, run the code cell.  This should return the following output:\n> <font color='#cc3333'>Incorrect:</font> Incorrect value for `one`: `2`\n\n    This means we still have the wrong answer to the question.\n\n\n3. Now, change the `2` to `1`, so that the line of code appears as `one = 1`. Then, run the code cell. The answer should be marked as <font color='#33cc33'>Correct</font>.
