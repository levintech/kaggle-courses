And, all users who joined the site in January 2019 should be included (even if they have never posted a question or provided an answer).\n\nThe query from the previous question should be a nice starting point to answering this question!  You'll need to use the `posts_answers` and `posts_questions` tables.  You'll also need to use the `users` table from the Stack Overflow dataset.
