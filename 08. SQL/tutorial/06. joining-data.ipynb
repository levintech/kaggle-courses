    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "You have the tools to obtain data from a single table in whatever format you want it. But what if the data you want is spread across multiple tables?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where **JOIN** comes in! **JOIN** is incredibly important in practical SQL workflows. So let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use our imaginary `pets` table, which has three columns: \n",
    "- `ID` - ID number for the pet\n",
    "- `Name` - name of the pet \n",
    "- `Animal` - type of animal \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also add another table, called `owners`.  This table also has three columns: \n",
    "- `ID` - ID number for the owner (different from the ID number for the pet)\n",
    "- `Name` - name of the owner\n",
    "- `Pet_ID` - ID number for the pet that belongs to the owner (which matches the ID number for the pet in the `pets` table)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/Rx6L4m1.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "To get information that applies to a certain pet, we match the `ID` column in the `pets` table to the `Pet_ID` column in the `owners` table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/eXvIORm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, \n",
    "- the `pets` table shows that Dr. Harris Bonkers is the pet with ID 1. \n",
    "- The `owners` table shows that Aubrey Little is the owner of the pet with ID 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "Putting these two facts together, Dr. Harris Bonkers is owned by Aubrey Little.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, we don't have to do this by hand to figure out which owner goes with which pet. In the next section, you'll learn how to use **JOIN** to create a new table combining information from the `pets` and `owners` tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# JOIN\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **JOIN**, we can write a query to create a table with just two columns: the name of the pet and the name of the owner. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/fLlng42.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We combine information from both tables by matching rows where the `ID` column in the `pets` table matches the `Pet_ID` column in the `owners` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the query, **ON** determines which column in each table to use to combine the tables.  Notice that since the `ID` column exists in both tables, we have to clarify which one to use.  We use `p.ID` to refer to the `ID` column from the `pets` table, and `o.Pet_ID` refers to the `Pet_ID` column from the `owners` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In general, when you're joining tables, it's a good habit to specify which table each of your columns comes from. That way, you don't have to pull up the schema every time you go back to read the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of **JOIN** we're using today is called an **INNER JOIN**. That means that a row will only be put in the final output table if the value in the columns you're using to combine them shows up in both the tables you're joining. For example, if Tom's ID number of 4 didn't exist in the `pets` table, we would only get 3 rows back from this query. There are other types of **JOIN**, but an **INNER JOIN** is very widely used, so it's a good one to start with."

    "# Example: How many files are covered by each type of software license?\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHub is the most popular place to collaborate on software projects. A GitHub **repository** (or **repo**) is a collection of files associated with a specific project.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Most repos on GitHub are shared under a specific legal license, which determines the legal restrictions on how they are used.  For our example, we're going to look at how many different files have been released under each license. \n",
    "\n",
