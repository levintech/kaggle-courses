Write a query that shows, for each hour of the day in the dataset, the corresponding number of trips and average speed.\n\nYour results should have three columns:\n- `hour_of_day` - sort by this column, which holds the result of extracting the hour from `trip_start_timestamp`.\n- `num_trips` - the count of the total number of trips in each hour of the day (e.g. how many trips were started between 6AM and 7AM, independent of which day it occurred on).\n- `avg_mph` - the average speed, measured in miles per hour, for trips that started in that hour of the day.  Average speed in miles per hour is calculated as `3600 * SUM(trip_miles) / SUM(trip_seconds)`. (The value 3600 is used to convert from seconds to hours.)\n\nRestrict your query to data meeting the following criteria:\n- a `trip_start_timestamp` between **2017-01-01** and **2017-07-01**\n- `trip_seconds` > 0 and `trip_miles` > 0\n\nYou will use a common table expression (CTE) to select just the relevant rides.
