The base we used was from a model called **VGG16**. We saw that the VGG16 architecture was prone to overfitting this dataset. Over this course, you'll learn a number of ways you can improve upon this initial attempt.\n\nThe first way you'll see is to use a base more appropriate to the dataset. The base this model comes from is called **InceptionV1** (also known as GoogLeNet). InceptionV1 was one of the early winners of the ImageNet competition. One of its successors, InceptionV4, is among the state of the art today.\n\nTo get started, run the code cell below to set everything up.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Setup feedback system\nfrom learntools.core import binder\nbinder.bind(globals())\nfrom learntools.computer_vision.ex1 import *\n\n# Imports\nimport os, warnings\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import gridspec\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport tensorflow as tf\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image_dataset_from_directory\n\n# Reproducability\ndef set_seed(seed=31415):\n    np.random.seed(seed)\n    tf.random.set_seed(seed)\n    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = str(seed)\n    os.environ['TF_DETERMINISTIC_OPS'] = '1'\nset_seed()\n\n# Set Matplotlib defaults\nplt.rc('figure', autolayout=True)\nplt.rc('axes', labelweight='bold', labelsize='large',\n       titleweight='bold', titlesize=18, titlepad=10)\nplt.rc('image', cmap='magma')\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\") # to clean up output cells\n\n\n# Load training and validation sets\nds_train_ = image_dataset_from_directory(\n    '../input/car-or-truck/train',\n    labels='inferred',\n    label_mode='binary',\n    image_size=[128, 128],\n    interpolation='nearest',\n    batch_size=64,\n    shuffle=True,\n)\nds_valid_ = image_dataset_from_directory(\n    '../input/car-or-truck/valid',\n    labels='inferred',\n    label_mode='binary',\n    image_size=[128, 128],\n    interpolation='nearest',\n    batch_size=64,\n    shuffle=False,\n)\n\n# Data Pipeline\ndef convert_to_float(image, label):\n    image = tf.image.convert_image_dtype(image, dtype=tf.float32)\n    return image, label\n\nAUTOTUNE = tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE\nds_train = (\n    ds_train_\n    .map(convert_to_float)\n    .cache()\n    .prefetch(buffer_size=AUTOTUNE)\n)\nds_valid = (\n    ds_valid_\n    .map(convert_to_float)\n    .cache()\n    .prefetch(buffer_size=AUTOTUNE)\n)\n","metadata":{"lines_to_next_cell":2,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-07-17T23:49:32.437190Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-07-17T23:49:32.437974Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-07-17T23:49:45.923818Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-07-17T23:49:32.437864Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-07-17T23:49:45.922843Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The **InceptionV1** model pretrained on ImageNet is available in the [TensorFlow Hub](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/) repository, but we'll load it from a local copy.
